Write complete C program to enter marks (limited to 0 to 100) of 10 subjects of a 
student and find the average marks for all the 10 subjects and grade the student 
according to the average marks. 

i. Write a function to input a mark and validate it between 0 and 100 for a subject.

ii. Write a function to calculate the total of each marks validated marks using given 
formula.

Use the total = total + marks for counting total for 10 subjects.
(Note: use for loop or while loop for entering marks and calculating total.)

iii. Write a function to calculate average marks of 10 subjects 

average = total / total no of subjects

iv. Write the main program to enter and validate, calculate total, calculate average 
marks and to print the average marks. Write functions with correct function calls 
and parameter passing.
